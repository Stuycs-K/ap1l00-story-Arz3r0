Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no cash 
in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on life, I thought I would <REPLACE_THIS_VERB> about 
a little and see the <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the 
fun and regulating circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the planet; 
whenever it is a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE>, <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> November in my house; whenever I find myself involuntarily 
<REPLACE_THIS_VERB> before coffin king, and bringing up the rear of every moose I meet; and 
especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> 
moral principle to prevent me from deliberately <REPLACE_THIS_VERB> into the safe, and methodically 
<REPLACE_THIS_VERB> people's cats off—then, I account it high time to get to therapy as soon as I can. 
There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all students in their degree, 
some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the world with me.
