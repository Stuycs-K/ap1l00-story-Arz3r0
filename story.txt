Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no cash 
in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on _life_, I thought I would think about philosophy
a little and see the *sad* part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the 
fun and regulating circulation. Whenever I find myself growing *grim* about the planet; 
whenever it is a snowy, cold November in my house; whenever I find myself involuntarily 
crying before coffin king, and bringing up the rear of every moose I meet; and 
especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a __huge__ 
moral principle to prevent me from deliberately breaking into the safe, and methodically 
scaring people's cats off—then, I account it high time to get to _therapy_ as soon as I can. 
There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all **students** in their degree, 
some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the world with me.
